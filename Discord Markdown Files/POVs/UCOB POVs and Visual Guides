*Notes: Clean run of Gunbreaker Point of View using NAUR (NA Ultimate Raiding) strats. Also included: Double shield. Taking the second fireball in twin with a 5 stack as well to build extra LB. Tank LB3 on transition with healers specifically healing to get us LB3 back. Normal Octet (No Tank LB3, with megaflare stacking in the tower closest to twin plus clockwise.) As well as caster LB3 in adds.*

*Notes: Holding DPS to view more extra mechs. So don't use it for DPS rotation of PLD, but all of it is good for Mitigation / mechanics*

*Notes: Prioritize SMN card target during their Baha phase | Star timings for safely healing trios: QM Castbar - Pops after spreads, End of Fellruin castbar - Pops after Nael dives, As dodging Hfall (on cd) - Pops before stack, Tenstrike (on cd) - Can pop to heal before earthshakers, or explodes naturally before giga*
